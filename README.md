# University LMS Login Page (Frontend)

This is a simple **Login Page** for the University Learning Management System (LMS), designed for students. The page is built using **Bootstrap 5 (BS5)** and **Tailwind CSS** frameworks to provide a responsive, modern design.

**Note**: This module is currently a **static frontend** without any backend functionality. It only includes the layout, styling, and basic user interface (UI) elements.
